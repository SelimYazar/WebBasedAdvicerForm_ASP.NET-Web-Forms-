# WebBasedAdvicerForm_ASP.NET-Web-Forms-
This project is an ASP.NET Web Forms application designed to provide personalized travel and hobby recommendations based on user inputs. The form allows users to input details such as their name, country, hobbies, gender, and birthday. Based on this data, the application generates a set of recommendations tailored to the userâ€™s preferences, including location-specific recommendations, hobby-related spots, and age-specific activities.

Features
Personalized Recommendations: Based on the user's country, hobbies, gender, and age group, the application generates a list of recommended places and activities.
Dynamic Form: The form elements, such as input fields, dropdowns, and checkboxes, dynamically update with hover and focus effects.
Date of Birth Validation: Ensures that the user inputs a valid date of birth that is not in the future.
Hobby Selection: Users can select multiple hobbies, and based on their selections, the application suggests hobby-related places to visit.
Interactive UI: The application uses CSS animations and media queries to ensure a smooth and responsive user experience across all devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
